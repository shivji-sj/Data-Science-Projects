The data is the price history and trading volumes of the fifty stocks in the index NIFTY 50 from NSE (National Stock Exchange) India. All datasets are at a day-level with pricing and trading values split across .cvs files for each stock along with a metadata file with some macro-information about the stocks itself. The data spans from 1st January, 2000 to 30th April, 2021.

Update Frequency
Since new stock market data is generated and made available every day, in order to have the latest and most useful information, the dataset will be updated once a month.
